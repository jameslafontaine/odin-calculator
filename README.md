# Odin Calculator

A simple calculator application developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations section. This project demonstrates foundational JavaScript skills, along with HTML and CSS, to create an interactive calculator with basic arithmetic functions and user-friendly design.

## Project Description

This project is a browser-based calculator app that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations. It showcases the use of JavaScript for implementing calculation logic, DOM manipulation for handling user input, and CSS for styling the calculator interface.

## Features

-   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
-   **Clear and Reset Options**: Allows users to reset the calculator and clear current inputs.
-   **Chained Operations**: Users can perform multiple calculations sequentially without pressing `=` after each operation.

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

-   **DOM Manipulation**: Creating interactive buttons and updating the display in response to user actions.
-   **Event Handling**: Handling `click` events for numeric and operator buttons, as well as special functions like clear and equals.
-   **JavaScript Logic**: Writing functions to handle arithmetic operations and chaining calculations.
-   **CSS Flexbox Layout**: Structuring the calculator layout for a clean, user-friendly interface.

## How to Use

1. Enter a number, then select an arithmetic operator (+, -, \*, /), and enter a second number.
2. Press `=` to see the result or select another arithmetic operator
   to chain together a calculation. You can also ignore the result of a
   calculation and begin a new one by simply entering numbers again.
3. Use the `AC` button to clear the display and start a brand new calculation.

## Future Improvements

-   [ ] Redesign or improve the calculator's visual design.
-   [ ] Add a `+/-` button for toggling between positive and negative numbers.
-   [ ] Implement percentage calculations to handle percentage-based operations.
-   [ ] Add a `.` button to allow input of decimal numbers.
-   [ ] Include a “backspace” button, so users can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.
-   [ ] Enable keyboard support for enhanced accessibility and ease of use.
-   [ ] Display a zero by default instead of a blank display for a more intuitive start.
